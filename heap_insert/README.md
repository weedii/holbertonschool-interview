Write a function that creates a binary tree node:

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
value is the value to put in the new node
When created, a node does not have any children
Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure
